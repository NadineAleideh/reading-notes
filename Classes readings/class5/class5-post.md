# Class 05 Learnings

Today we have an introduction to the data structures which is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. And there are several data structures each one of them May can the best structure to a specific problem; we can choose the appropriate data structure by specifying these things first the type of the data how we want to access this data and the speed of access. one of these data structures is the linked list to understand the benefits of it , I will ask a question what if we want to store a collection of data I think the first suggestion will be brought to our minds is the array but what if we want to add elements remove elements without causing a high time and space complexity; so the Linked list will solve the problem it's have a dynamic size so it can grow or Shrink without limitations it doesn't follow the contiguous block in the memory like arrays So it's easier in removing , shifting , adding elements to this collection. There are two types of linked list the single linked list and the doubly linked list today we implement the single linked list and do some functions on it so I am now familiar dealing with the it.

So, what I want to learn more about is the doubly linked list and practice more on it.
