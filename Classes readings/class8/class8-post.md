# Class 08 Learnings

I learned about collections in C# what it mean, what's the benefits of it, it's types specially (Generic collections ) and why it's important sometimes and when should I use them to store the objects instead of the other way which is the arrays. Also, I'm now familiar with enumeration types which is a user-defined data type that consists of a set of named integral constants and what's the benefit of using them in our code that it  improve code readability and maintainability and when we can use them like switch statements, method parameters, properties.
