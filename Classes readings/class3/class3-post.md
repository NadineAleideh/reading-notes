# Class 03 Learnings

I learned form this lecture about the system.io library that I can manipulate the files through it. It provides a wide classes and methods like File class and stream. the main reason of using files in the .NET apps is if we want to debug live production of our app and saving the logging sessions we will use files instead of DB because if we did this will consume the storage of it and the retrieving speed will be less than retrieving from files , In addition if the user wants to upload Images or anything to the app we will use files. I learned how to deal with files in it's basic way 1- open the file 2- do your work 3- close the file.

Â I familiar now with these methods : ReadAllText, ReadAllBytes, ReadAllLines, WriteAllText, WriteAllLines using the during the lab , and I learned about the Dictionary is a data structure in C# that represents a collection of key-value pairs, where each key must be unique. Also I emphasized my knowledge about the Binary search.
