# Navigation Properties and Routing

## why this topic matters as it relates to what Iam studying in this module?

Routing and endpoints in ASP.NET MVC Core provides a powerful and flexible way to handle incoming requests, making it easy to build robust and maintainable web applications.

## Routing in ASP.NET MVC Core

Routing in ASP.NET MVC Core is responsible for determining how incoming HTTP requests are mapped to specific action methods in controllers. It plays a crucial role in directing the flow of requests to the appropriate code that should handle them. The routing system uses route templates, which are URL patterns with placeholders for capturing dynamic values, to define how URLs should be matched.

When a request comes into an ASP.NET MVC Core application, the routing middleware analyzes the URL and tries to find a match with the defined route templates. If a match is found, the routing system extracts the values from the URL and uses them to identify the appropriate controller and action method to handle the request. The extracted values can be used as parameters for the action method.

## Endpoint in ASP.NET MVC Core

An endpoint in ASP.NET MVC Core represents a discrete unit of execution that can handle an incoming HTTP request. It is the result of the routing process, where the routing middleware has successfully matched a request to a specific route template and identified the associated controller and action method.

Endpoints encapsulate information about the selected route, such as the route pattern, route data (values extracted from the URL), and the delegate responsible for executing the action method. Once an endpoint is determined, it is passed along the middleware pipeline for further processing.

ASP.NET MVC Core uses endpoints to follow the request-handling process. When a request reaches the endpoint, the corresponding action method is executed, and the response generated by the action method is sent back to the client.

Endpoints are a fundamental part of the request pipeline, allowing ASP.NET MVC Core to efficiently handle incoming requests and execute the appropriate code to generate the response.
