# Class 09 Readings: Readings: LINQ & Delegates

## LINQ

LINQ, or Language-Integrated Query, is a technology that allows developers to write queries directly in the C# programming language, providing a convenient and consistent way to query and manipulate different types of data sources, such as objects, databases, and XML documents.

## Delegates

A delegate is like a pointer to a method. It represents a specific type of method with defined parameters and return type. When you create a delegate, you can connect it to any method that has a similar signature. Then, you can use the delegate to call or invoke that method. It provides a convenient way to refer to and execute different methods using a single delegate instance.

## Why this topic matters

- **LINQ** offers a major advantage by enabling developers to use the same C# language they already know and love to write queries for different data sources. This eliminates the need to learn and switch between multiple query languages specific to each data type. With LINQ, developers can seamlessly work with various data sources like objects, databases, and XML documents, using a unified syntax. This simplifies the code and improves readability, making it easier to query and manipulate data effectively.
- **Delegates** offer a handy way to refer to and call different methods using a single delegate instance. They provide flexibility by allowing dynamic method invocation, which is useful when the specific method to be called may change. Delegates also simplify implementing callbacks and event handling, making code more modular and flexible. In summary, delegates make it easier to work with methods and enhance the flexibility and extensibility of your code.

## Basic LINQ Query Operations

- Obtaining a Data Source: This step is about finding and choosing the data you want to work with. It could be a list of things, a table in a database, or information from an XML document.

- Filtering: Filtering means picking out only the data that meets certain conditions or rules. It's like using a sieve to separate what you need from what you don't need.

- Ordering: Ordering is about arranging the data in a particular sequence, like putting things in order from smallest to largest or alphabetically. It helps make the data easier to understand and work with.

- Grouping: Grouping involves putting similar data together based on a common characteristic. It's like organizing items into different categories so you can analyze or compare them more easily.

- Joining: Joining is about combining information from different sources based on something they have in common. It's like connecting puzzle pieces that fit together to get a complete picture.

- Selecting (Projections): Selecting or projection is about choosing specific information or creating new information from the data you have. It's like picking out certain details or creating summaries to focus on what's important.

## Delegates types

There are three types of delegates in C#:

1. Singlecast Delegates: They point to a single method at a time and are used when you want to call a specific method.

2. Multicast Delegates: They can point to multiple methods and are useful when you want to call multiple methods together.

3. Generic Delegates: They are flexible delegates that can work with different method signatures, providing better type safety. They eliminate the need to create custom delegates for each method signature.

## Things I want to know more about

- About Data Transformations with LINQ. becuase as I read that (LINQ) is not only about retrieving data. It is also a powerful tool for transforming data.
