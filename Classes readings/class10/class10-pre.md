# Implementation: Stacks and Queues

**Stacks:**

- A stack is a data structure that consists of nodes.
- Nodes can be added to the stack using the "push" operation and removed using the "pop" operation.
- The top of the stack refers to the most recently added node.
- Stacks follow the FILO (First In Last Out) or LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.
- The "push" operation adds a node to the top of the stack, while the "pop" operation removes the top node.
- The "peek" operation allows you to view the value of the top node without removing it.
- The "isEmpty" operation checks if the stack is empty or not.
- O(1) time complexity for push, pop and peek operations.

**Queues:**

- A queue is a data structure that also consists of nodes.
- Nodes can be added to the queue using the "enqueue" operation and removed using the "dequeue" operation.
- The front of the queue refers to the first node, while the rear refers to the last node.
- Queues follow the FIFO (First In First Out) or LILO (Last In Last Out) principle.
- The "enqueue" operation adds a node to the rear of the queue, while the "dequeue" operation removes the front node.
- The "peek" operation allows you to view the value of the front node without removing it.
- The "isEmpty" operation checks if the queue is empty or not.
- O(1) time complexity for enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations.

**Stacks** and **queues** have their own benefits and disadvantages. Stacks are simple and efficient, with a constant time complexity for push, pop, and peek operations. They are particularly useful for backtracking, recursion, and nested function calls. Stacks are also employed in algorithms like depth-first search and for implementing undo/redo functionality. However, stacks have a fixed size and can overflow, lack efficient access to middle elements, and may cause stack overflow errors in deep recursion.

On the other hand, queues are valuable when preserving the order of elements is important, such as in task scheduling or request handling. They have a constant time complexity for enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations and are commonly used in breadth-first search algorithms and simulations. Nevertheless, queues suffer from similar limitations as stacks, including fixed size, inefficient access to middle elements, and potential delays in processing if certain elements take longer.

The choice between stacks and queues depends on the specific requirements of the problem, considering factors such as order preservation and the need for efficient element access.
