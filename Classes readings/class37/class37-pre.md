# Readings: JAM Stack

## What is JAM Stack

JAMstack is a modern web development architecture that stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. It's a way of building websites and web applications that emphasizes decoupling the frontend from the backend, relying on pre-built, client-side rendering, and utilizing APIs to handle dynamic functionality. JAMstack can lead to faster and more secure web applications with improved performance and scalability.

## Key components of JAMstack

1. **JavaScript:** JavaScript is used to enhance the user experience by adding interactivity and dynamic features to your static site or app.

2. **APIs:** APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are used to fetch and send data to various services and databases. These APIs can be third-party services like Stripe for payments or your own custom APIs for handling data.

3. **Markup:** Markup refers to the HTML files that contain the content and structure of your site or app. These are pre-built during the build process and served as static files.
