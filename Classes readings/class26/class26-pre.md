# Readings: Intro to MVC

## Tag Helpers in ASP.NET Core

Tag Helpers in ASP.NET Core facilitate server-side participation in generating and rendering HTML elements within Razor files, offering benefits like an HTML-centric development experience, improved IntelliSense support, and increased productivity. They enable tasks such as automatically appending version numbers to image names, ensuring up-to-date images without manual intervention. Unlike HTML Helpers, Tag Helpers streamline the transition between HTML and C# code, catering to both front-end designers and experienced developers. However, they are not compatible with Razor components. Overall, Tag Helpers enhance code maintainability and reliability by leveraging server-side information to produce more robust web applications.

## MVC Basics

MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a fundamental architectural pattern used in software development, particularly for designing and structuring web applications. The pattern separates an application into three interconnected components, each with its own distinct role:

- Model: The Model represents the data and the business logic of the application. It encapsulates the application's core functionality, such as data handling, validation, and calculations. Models often interact with databases or other data sources to retrieve or manipulate data. Separating data and logic into the Model makes the application more maintainable and easier to modify without affecting the user interface or other components.

- View: The View is responsible for rendering the user interface. It presents the data from the Model to the user and provides an interactive interface for user interactions. Views are designed to display information in a readable and understandable format. In the context of web applications, Views are typically HTML templates that incorporate placeholders for dynamic data.

- Controller: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It handles user requests, processes input, and orchestrates the interaction between the Model and the View. When a user interacts with the application, such as submitting a form, the Controller receives the input, performs necessary actions on the Model, and then selects the appropriate View to display the updated information.

### Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework that provides a set of pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components for building responsive and visually appealing web applications and websites. Developed by Twitter, Bootstrap simplifies web development by offering a standardized collection of design elements, such as navigation bars, buttons, grids, forms, and modals, that can be easily customized and integrated into projects. Its responsive features ensure that applications adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices, enhancing user experience. With its extensive documentation and community support, Bootstrap has become a go-to choice for developers looking to create modern, consistent, and responsive web interfaces.
