# Class 06 Readings: Object Oriented Principles

## Why this topic matters

Object-oriented principles in C# give a foundation for creating and developing software systems that make use of the concepts of objects and classes. These principles provide a framework for organizing code, increasing reusability, and simplifying maintenance. So, developers can create C# applications that extensible, and easier to understand and maintain over time.

## Object Oriented Principles

1. Abstraction is the representation of important properties of an entity while hiding unnecessary details. It enables the development of abstract classes and interfaces that define common behaviors that can be implemented by multiple classes.

2. Encapsulation is the process of grouping data and associated functions into a single unit known as a class. It guarantees that an object's innermost workings are hidden from external code, allowing interaction via a well-defined interface.

3. Inheritance allows for creation of new classes that depend on existing ones and inherit their properties. It encourages code reuse and creates a hierarchical connection between classes, allowing derived classes to inherit attributes and actions from a base class.

4. Polymorphism is the ability to regard objects of different classes as instances of one common class. It allows methods in derived classes to be overridden, allowing for multiple implementations while maintaining a consistent interface. So, you can work with diverse objects in a unified manner. For example, in a drawing application with various shape types, a class hierarchy can be created where each shape class derives from a common base class. Using virtual methods, the base class can invoke the appropriate method in any derived class, enabling uniform handling of different shapes.

If there are any additional Object Oriented Principles, the primary use of these principles, as well as how to apply them into a project.
