# Class 06 Learnings

Today I have applied what I learned about (OOP) object-oriented programming principles by implemented a zoo management system and I emphasized the concepts of Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism in a practical way. Also, I learned what is a UML diagram which is visual representation of the class hierarchy and relationships between all classes that represents the system, and how to draw it.
