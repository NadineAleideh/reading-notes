# Data Transfer Objects

In ASP.NET Core MVC, Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) are classes used to transfer data between different layers of an application, such as the Controller and the View or between the Controller and the Service layers. DTOs are simple objects that carry only the necessary data and do not contain any business logic. They help to decouple the internal data model from the external representation, improving maintainability and security.

We use this approach when we might want to:

- Remove circular references.
- Hide particular properties that clients are not supposed to view.
- Omit some properties in order to reduce payload size.
- Flatten object graphs that contain nested objects, to make them more convenient for clients.
- Avoid "over-posting" vulnerabilities.
- Decouple your service layer from your database layer.

## Why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module

DTOs play a crucial role in maintaining a clear separation of concerns and improving the overall maintainability, scalability, and performance of your application or API. They provide a standardized and efficient way to transfer data, promoting good design practices and simplifying the integration of different components in your system.

## Advantages

1. **Decoupling and Encapsulation:** DTOs separate the internal data model from the client-facing representation, enabling backend modifications without affecting clients.

2. **Reduced Data Transfer:** DTOs let APIs send only required data, preventing over-fetching or under-fetching and optimizing network efficiency.

3. **Enhanced Security:** By controlling exposed data, DTOs protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access.

4. **Versioning and API Evolution:** Using DTOs allows APIs to evolve while maintaining compatibility with existing clients.

5. **Performance Optimization:** DTOs reduce data size and improve data processing efficiency, enhancing application performance.

6. **Client Flexibility:** DTOs enable tailoring data for different clients' needs, accommodating diverse data structures.

7. **Mapping and Transformation:** DTOs facilitate seamless data transformation between different layers of the application.

8. **Cross-platform and Language Interoperability:** DTOs provide a language-agnostic data structure for smooth data exchange among multiple clients or microservices.
