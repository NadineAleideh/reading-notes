# Class 04 Learnings

I learned about Classes which is a blue print or structure that defines information and behavior about an entity and consists of three parts name of the class, data members, methods. and in real world apps consist of multiple classes each one responsible of one behavior and all together the whole functionally of this app, I learned  default and costume about constructors, properties with getrs and setrs and what the main propose of using them, object initializer, override methods, reference data type and value data types what the difference between them and where each one of these types stored ;   value data types stored in the stack which keeps tracking the program execution ,and the reference data type stored in heap where the data in our app resides , all large objects will be stored in the heap to preserve the app's program efficiency. and there is something called garbage collector which automatically clean up the heap from all unused data and free them periodically this keeps the memory management in a high level. Also, I worked with classes during the lab.
