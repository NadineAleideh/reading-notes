# Readings Class 02: Unit Testing and Documentation

1. Name 3 ways in which Unit Testing improves your codebase and productivity:

    - Early Bug Detection: Unit testing catches bugs early, preventing them from spreading to other parts of the codebase, which reduces debugging time and effort.

    - Code Refactoring and Maintenance: Unit tests act as a safety net, ensuring that changes to the codebase don't introduce unintended issues or break existing functionality, enabling more agile development and easier code maintenance.

    - Documentation and Code Understanding: Unit tests prompt developers to think about code usage and expected behavior, serving as executable documentation and providing examples of how to use specific parts of the codebase, thus enhancing code understanding and collaboration among team members.

2. How would you write a unit test for a household task such as putting away laundry?

    I would define a function that represents a specific step or behavior of the task and write assertions to verify its expected outcome. `test_put_away_laundry()` function is a unit test that verifies the behavior of the `put_away_laundry()` function. It could include assertions to ensure that the function returns the expected output or behaves correctly based on certain inputs.

3. Name 3 reasons a quality README is just as important as quality code.

    A quality README complements quality code by providing documentation, easing project understanding and collaboration, and fostering community engagement and adoption. It is an essential component of any software project, helping to ensure its success and maintainability.

4. When writing a README for your co-developers, name 4 crucial elements to include.

   - Project Overview: Provide a brief description of the project's purpose and goals.

   - Installation and Setup: Clearly explain how to install and set up the project, including any dependencies or prerequisites.

   - Usage and Examples: Describe how to use the project and provide illustrative examples.

   - Contribution Guidelines: Encourage and guide co-developers to contribute, specifying guidelines for bug reports, feature requests, coding style, and testing.

These elements ensure that co-developers quickly understand the project, can set it up easily, know how to use it effectively, and are empowered to contribute to its development.
