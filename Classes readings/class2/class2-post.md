# Learning Journal: Class 02

Today I learned about unit testing it's an automation way to test all functions in my code before lunching the App this reduces the testing time , reduce searching bugs and the bugs its ,allow refactoring, it helps focusing on the quality of the code, also it helps with documentation the code and making it more readable.

Also I learned about TTD approach that we have to write the test first for a specific unit then implementing the actual code testing the code for the first time and then go back to refactor the the code to reach the desire behavior.

In addition, I learned how to write a full testing code function with the difference between  `[fact]` and `[theory]`, `[Inline Data]` within the lab  and how to run these tests.

Finally , I deal with list , while , switch , global variables within the lab.
