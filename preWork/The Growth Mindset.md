# The Growth Mindset

The topic of preparing oneself to study a new programming and development course is crucial because it lays the foundation for successful learning and skill acquisition. Just as when I would carefully prepare my home before embarking on a renovation project, preparing oneself for a new course involves understanding the necessary tools, gathering resources, and cultivating the right mindset.

In the article "Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice," the concept of deliberate practice is highlighted. Deliberate practice involves intentionally focusing on specific areas of improvement, breaking down complex skills into smaller components, and engaging in targeted practice to enhance proficiency. This approach mirrors the careful planning and preparation required before starting a home renovation. It involves researching and understanding the specific skills and knowledge needed for the course, gathering relevant study materials and resources, and creating a structured plan for learning and practice.

In Carol Dweck's TEDxNorrkoping talk on "The power of believing that you can improve," she discusses the importance of having a growth mindset. Just as a homeowner needs to believe in their ability to learn and overcome challenges during a renovation project, adopting a growth mindset is essential for success in learning programming and development. Embracing the belief that skills can be developed through dedication, effort, and learning from mistakes empowers individuals to persist in the face of difficulties and setbacks.

Angela Lee Duckworth's TED Talks Education video on "Grit: The power of passion and perseverance" emphasizes the role of determination and perseverance in achieving long-term goals. Just as a homeowner must exhibit grit and determination to see a renovation project through to completion, developing grit is crucial for navigating the challenges and complexities of studying a new programming and development course. It involves maintaining focus, staying motivated, and persisting in the face of obstacles.

In Alain de Botton's TEDGlobal 2009 talk on "A kinder, gentler philosophy of success," he encourages a reevaluation of society's definition of success. Similarly, when preparing to study a new programming and development course, it is important to redefine personal success. Rather than solely focusing on immediate outcomes or comparing oneself to others, it is more beneficial to embrace a broader perspective. Success can be measured by the growth and progress made, the skills acquired, and the joy and fulfillment derived from the learning process itself.

In summary, just as a homeowner carefully prepares for a renovation project by understanding the necessary tools, gathering resources, and adopting the right mindset, preparing oneself for a new programming and development course requires deliberate practice, a growth mindset, grit, and a redefined notion of success. By incorporating these elements, individuals can effectively navigate the learning journey and maximize their chances of success in acquiring new technical skills.

## EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE SELF-ASSESSMENT TOOL

1. always I am aware of the physical reactions (twinges, aches,
sudden changes) that signal a “gut reaction.”

 I have a good overall level of emotional intelligence. I demonstrate self-awareness by being aware of physical reactions signaling gut reactions and identifying my emotions in the moment. I also show self-regulation by admitting mistakes, apologizing, and staying composed when angry. In terms of social awareness, I have a good ability to perceive others' perceptions, read non-verbal signals, and show empathy. While there are a few areas where I indicated lower frequency, such as adjusting assessments based on biases and managing negative emotions at work, overall, my results indicate a solid foundation of emotional intelligence.

## Bias Self-Assessment

My score is between 75 and 99, that's mean I’ve made some progress in this area but still have room to grow. I should continue improve the
areas of unconscious bias where I scored the lowest. I should prioritize my self care to improves my overall performance as well as my ability to mitigate bias. I should more like to challenge myself with
new points of view or opinions from podcasts, new authors or documentaries, or new hobbies in order to constantly learn and
expand my perspective.
